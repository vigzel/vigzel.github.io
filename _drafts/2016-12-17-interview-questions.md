## Best answers to "Would you like to ask any question" at the end of interview?

These are my favorite questions to ask. I feel they show a genuine interest in the position and it usually catches the interviewer off guard, and at the very least, it's payback for the bullshit "Where do you see yourself in 5 yrs" type questions.

 - How would you describe the culture here at (job company)?
 - How did this position come to be open?
 - What does success look like for this position?
 - What is the biggest achievement this department has made?
 - What is the biggest challenge facing this department right now?
 - Besides a paycheck, what keeps you coming back to work here every day?

Most of the questions let you see how full of shit they are. You get the upper hand in the most friendly was possible and it definitely gives you a little more insight into the position and company. Most of the time they get caught off guard and give a generic answer, all the places that hired me/I decided to work at had a solid response right off the bat. Lastly, this is bit of a wild card question, but I like to drop this at the very end and have never gotten a "No"...
 - Would you mind giving me a tour of where this job would take place so I can get a feel of where I'd be working and who I would be working with?
Chances are NO ONE has ever asked this question, and sometimes it can really help break the ice and give you a slight edge when it's time to select a candidate.


## What’s the fastest way to sort an array on disk that’s too large to fit into memory?
Bad programmer: Here’s the optimal algorithm from Knuth, and here’s commentary from CLRS. Just input your array size and expected disk latency to tune performance.

Good programmer: Can you tell me what it is you’re trying to do?  

Grizzled veterans may recognize this problem from chapter one of Jon Bentley’s excellent Programming Pearls.  
In the world outside of programming contests, defining the actual problem to solve is known to take a few iterations. In this (real world) case, the optimal solution ended up using no sorting at all and relied on a bit array that fit comfortably within memory.  
Bad programmers answer the question that was asked. Good programmers learn to probe a bit deeper.
