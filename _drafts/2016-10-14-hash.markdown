**m-bit hash function h(x)** is a hash function which takes an arbitrary object as input, and outputs m bits  

**hashing** is irreversible, compression = reversible.  It is possible to use a hash as a compression function. But since there is no way to calculate the original text from the hash, this compression method can only be used when the original text is available.


## Probability of hash collision
Given k randomly generated values, where each value is a non-negative integer less than N, what is the probability that at least two of them are equal?
 * Given a space of N possible hash values, suppose youâ€™ve already picked a single value. After that, there are N - 1  remaining values (out of a possible ) that are unique from the first. Therefore, the probability of randomly generating two integers that are unique from each other is (N - 1)/N
 * After that, there are N - 2  remaining values (out of a possible ) that are unique from the first two, which means that the probability of randomly generating three integers that are all unique is (N-1)/N * (N-2)/N. (We can multiply the probabilities together because each random number generation is an independent event.)
 * In general, the probability of randomly generating  integers that are all unique is: 
                                   
$$ {N-1 \over N} x {N-2 \over N} x ... x {N-(k-2) \over N} x {N-(k-1) \over N} $$


The above expression is approximately equal to: 

$$ {e^{-k(k-1) \over 2N}} $$                                                                   

Subtract it from one, and you have the probability of a hash collision:
