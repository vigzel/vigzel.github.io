`eerie` - strange and frightening

`ad hoc` - a Latin phrase meaning "for this". It generally signifies a solution designed for a specific problem or task, non-generalizable, and not intended to be able to be adapted to other purposes (compare a priori). 

`seldom` - not often; rarely

`itinerary` -  A route or proposed route of a journey.

`DOM`
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is an API for manipulating HTML and XML documents. It provides a structural representation of the document, enabling you to modify its content and visual presentation by using a scripting language such as JavaScript.
- The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages. A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window, or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) provides another way to represent, store and manipulate that same document. The DOM is a fully object-oriented representation of the web page, and it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

`dichotomy` - a division or contrast between two things that are represented as being opposed or entirely different.

`delegate`
 - a type-safe object that points to another method (or possibly a list of methods), which can be invoked at a later time.
 - it has three pieces of information: address of the method, parameters and return type.
